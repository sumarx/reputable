      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Problem</h2>
      <p>Restaurant owners are drowning in reviews scattered across Google, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. Responding to each one takes hours. Negative reviews slip through the cracks. And there's no easy way to understand what customers really think at scale.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Our Solution</h2>
      <p>RepuTable brings all your reviews into one dashboard. Our AI analyzes sentiment in real-time, generates smart reply suggestions in seconds, and helps you proactively collect more positive reviews through QR code campaigns. What used to take hours now takes minutes.</p>
