    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and business information (restaurant name, location details). We also collect review data from connected platforms (Google, Facebook, TripAdvisor, Yelp) that you explicitly authorize.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to provide the RepuTable service, including aggregating reviews, generating AI-powered sentiment analysis and reply suggestions, and displaying analytics. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">3. AI Processing</h2>
    <p>Review text is processed through AI models to generate sentiment analysis and reply suggestions. This data is processed in real-time and is not used to train AI models. Your review data remains private to your account.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored on secure servers with encryption at rest and in transit. We implement industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (TLS), secure password hashing, and regular security audits.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We integrate with Google Business Profile, Facebook, TripAdvisor, and Yelp APIs to fetch reviews on your behalf. These integrations only access data you explicitly authorize. We also use AI services for sentiment analysis and reply generation.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. Upon account deletion, all your data (including reviews, analytics, and personal information) will be permanently deleted within 30 days.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">7. Your Rights</h2>
